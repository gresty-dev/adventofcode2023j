The code in this repository mostly follows the [automation guidelines on the /r/adventofcode community wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation/).

- **Only inputs requested:** The only requests this code makes against adventofcode.com are to download puzzle input.
- **Inputs are cached:** Inputs are locally cached so that any given input is only requested once. To download again, the cached file must be deleted. 
- **Requests are not throttled:** But this script makes at most one request before exiting.
